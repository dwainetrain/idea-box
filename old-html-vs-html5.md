Week 1 Assignment

I was having a heck of a time finding old html/xhtml sites, especially since most blogs and templated sites have updated their structure. Even blog posts exhaulting xhtml as the best, new thing are being rendered in html5. So, I just used the migration guide from w3schools, along with their official document on changes, to explore some fundamental differences.

1. Explicit content tags: Instead of a rash of <div id="foo">'s we get explicit tags for headers, footers, navigations, etc...
2. Simplified doctype declaration: Instead of the full spec at the top, we can simply write <!DOCTYPE html>
3. Audio and video embedding, thank the gods! No more flash or quicktime embeds, which were nightmares of the earlier web.
4. Many of the presentation elements that existed in HTML4 were stripped because they were best implemented in CSS.
5. The designation of in-line or block level elements, as far as html, have been replaced with a different, more encompassing selection of elements, including Metadata, Flow or Interactive.

I took a peek at the source code for the Html5 Differences page:
Questions about HTML:
Is <a href...> deprecated?
Why would they choose to <div id="head"> over <head>?
Is there a new specification in the works? An HTML6?
